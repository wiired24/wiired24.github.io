Game Dev Simplified was created with the hope that it will be useful for anyone just getting started with game development. We wanted to create an easy to use resource that you can learn from as you progress through your development journey. All the content on this blog is free. If you get stuck on a problem you're having or just want input from the community we do have a Discord that you're welcome to join. Have fun building your game and best of luck and may the odds be ever in your favor
